If you want to download and convert FBL map files for iGO navigation, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Find a reliable source of FBL map files online. You can search for them using keywords like "fbl map files download" or "fbl map files free". Make sure the files are compatible with your iGO version and device model.
2. Download the FBL map files to your computer. You may need to unzip them if they are compressed. The downloaded files are usually stored in a folder named after the file you used to download them.
3. Copy the FBL map files to your iGO device or app. You will need to connect your device to your computer using a USB cable or a wireless connection. Then, locate the iGO folder on your device and copy the FBL map files to the content/map subfolder.
4. Launch the iGO navigation software on your device or app. You should be able to see the new maps in the settings menu. You can select the map you want to use and start navigating.
