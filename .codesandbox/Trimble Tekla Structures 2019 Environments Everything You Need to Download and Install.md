# How to Install and Use Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 Environments
 
Tekla Structures is a powerful software for building information modeling (BIM) that allows you to create, combine, manage and share accurate multi-material 3D models of any structures. Tekla Structures supports various design and construction workflows, from conceptual design to fabrication and erection.

One of the features of Tekla Structures is that it allows you to customize your modeling environment according to your specific needs and preferences. Tekla Structures environments are sets of configurations, settings, components, profiles, materials, and other elements that define how you work with Tekla Structures in different situations. For example, there are environments for different countries, regions, standards, disciplines, and project types.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and use Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 environments, which are available for free download from the Tekla User Assistance website. We will also explain some of the changes and improvements that have been made to the environment folder structure and installation process in Tekla Structures 2019.

To install Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 environments, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the [Installing/Uninstalling Tekla Structures Environments from Version 2019](https://support.tekla.com/article/installinguninstalling-tekla-structures-environments-from-version-2019) article on the Tekla User Assistance website.
2. Select the environment that you want to install from the list of available environments. You can also use the search function to find a specific environment.
3. Click the Download button to download the environment installer file. The file name has the format `TeklaStructures_2019_EnvironmentName.tsep`, where `EnvironmentName` is the name of the environment.
4. Run the environment installer file by double-clicking it or right-clicking it and selecting Run as administrator.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You may need to accept the license agreement and select the installation folder.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for any other environments that you want to install.

Note that from Tekla Structures 2019 onwards, there has been a change to the environment folder structure and environment installers now contain `.tsep` installers. These changes are explained in more detail in the [Changes in Tekla Structures installation](https://support.tekla.com/article/changes-in-tekla-structures-installation) article on the Tekla User Assistance website.
 
## Using Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 Environments
 
To use Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 environments, follow these steps:

1. Start Tekla Structures 2019 by clicking its icon on your desktop or in your Start menu.
2. In the Start dialog box that opens, select an environment from the drop-down list under Environment. You can also select a role and a configuration if available.
3. Click OK to open a new model or Open... to open an existing model.
4. You can now work with Tekla Structures using the selected environment. You can access various environment-specific features and settings from the menus, toolbars, dialogs, and property panels.
5. To change the environment for an existing model, go to File > Settings > Switch Environment... and select a new environment from the list. Note that switching environments may affect your model data and settings, so make sure you back up your model before doing so.

You can find more information about using Trimble Tekla Structures 2019 environments in the [Getting started with Tekla Structures](https://support.tekla.com/doc/tekla-structures/2019/en/int_getting_started_with_tekla_structures) guide and other documentation on the Tekla User Assistance website.
