Gamze Ozcelik, who was born in 1982, is a famous Turkish actress, model and TV hostess. She is best known for her roles in popular TV series such as "Arka Sokaklar", "Serseri" and "Asmali Konak". She has also appeared in several movies and commercials. She was married to actor Ugur Pektas from 2008 to 2013.
  
Gokhan Demirkol, who was born in 1977, is a Turkish singer and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the boy band "Athena" in the late 1990s. He later pursued a solo career and acted in some TV shows and movies. He was accused of raping Ozcelik in 2005 and was arrested and tried for the crime.
  
The scandal broke out when the video clip, which was allegedly recorded by Demirkol without Ozcelik's consent, was leaked to the internet and circulated widely. The clip showed Ozcelik and Demirkol in a hotel room, engaging in sexual acts. Ozcelik claimed that she was drugged and raped by Demirkol, who denied the allegations and said that the sex was consensual.
  
The case attracted a lot of media attention and public interest, as it involved two celebrities and a sensitive issue of sexual violence. The trial was marked by twists and turns, as both sides presented conflicting evidence and testimonies. Ozcelik's family and friends supported her claims, while Demirkol's lawyers argued that she was lying to tarnish his reputation.
  
In 2007, Demirkol was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison for raping Ozcelik. However, he appealed the verdict and was released on bail after spending eight months in jail. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Appeals overturned the conviction and ordered a retrial. In 2012, Demirkol was acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence.
  
The scandal had a lasting impact on both Ozcelik's and Demirkol's careers and personal lives. Ozcelik suffered from depression and trauma after the incident and took a break from acting for several years. She later resumed her work and became more active in social causes, such as women's rights and animal welfare. She also remarried in 2019.
  
Demirkol faced public backlash and criticism after the scandal and lost many fans and opportunities. He struggled to revive his career and faced financial difficulties. He also had some legal troubles, such as being sued by his ex-wife for alimony and being arrested for drug possession.
