Level-D 767 has received many positive reviews from users and critics alike. It is praised for its realistic and comprehensive simulation of the 767 systems, flight dynamics, and cockpit. It is also compatible with many add-ons and utilities, such as Active Sky, FS2Crew, and Navigraph. Many users consider it to be one of the best add-ons for FSX and P3D.
 
However, Level-D 767 is not without its flaws. Some users have reported issues with video card compatibility, performance, and stability. Some also find the graphics to be outdated and lacking in detail, especially compared to newer add-ons. The virtual cockpit is not fully 3D modeled and some switches and dials are represented by 2D images. The external model is also criticized for being too shiny and having inaccurate winglets.
 
Overall, Level-D 767 is a great add-on for those who want to experience flying a complex and realistic airliner in FSX or P3D. It offers a lot of features and challenges that will keep you engaged and entertained. However, if you are looking for a more modern and visually appealing add-on, you might want to look elsewhere. Level-D 767 is showing its age and might not meet your expectations.
